# OXXO web scraping project
The purpose of this project is to show the distribution of OXXO, the biggest convenience store in Latin America.

This project was made with Python using libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Pandas to pull and transform raw data from a website. Then I exported the data into LookerStudio to create a dashboard showing the location of each store and some interesting insights.
Take a look at the dashboard here: (https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/gVBQO5lOhoY)
